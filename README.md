# Biome
*Evolutionary learning in a simulated environment*

## Setup
1. Install cmake
2. run `mkdir build`
3. run `cd build`
4. run `cmake`
5. run `make`
6. run `./test_code`

Each time you make changes to main.cpp, sim.cpp, or sim.h, you will need to rerun `make` in terminal. Execute code from the build directory, which is ignored in git by default.
